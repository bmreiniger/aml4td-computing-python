Don't commit the rendered files. (N.B. in this draft we're publishing from the `/docs` repo and this doesn't apply; when we migrate this'll probably change) -->\n\n - Keep the changes small in scope. If the overall change is larger, make a sequence of small pull requests. \n - The edits cannot include exact code that is under another license (i.e., don't just copy/paste from R sources, etc.)\n <!-- - Respect the existing code formatting/linting (as heterogeneous as it is).  -->\n\n - Stick to using python for computations.  \n - Don't update software versions unless you have to. If you need to update or add something, use Pipenv (described below) to codify the software requirements.  \n\n<!-- A merged PR will make you appear in the contributor list (see below). -->\nA merged PR is considered a donation of your work to this project. \nYou are still bound by the conditions of the license, meaning that you are **not considered an author, copyright holder, or owner** of the content once it has been merged in.\n\nYou will mostly work with the `*.qmd` files in the `chapters` directory. \n\nHere is a list of the elements in the repo: \n\n```\n├── _book                       # Created by quarto\n├── _cache                      # Location of cached chunks  \n├── _freeze                     # Created by quarto\n├── _quarto.yml                 # configuration file\n├── chapters                    # qmd content files\n├── data                        # data files\n├── figures                     # Location for created image files \n── includes                     # tex, bib, and html files to include\n├── index.qmd                   # Initial quarto file\n├── license.*                   # License information\n├── Pipfile                     # basic environment specification\n└── Pipfile.lock                # full environment specification\n```\n\n## Software\n\n\n\n### Quarto\n\nQuarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system.\n[Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) version 1\\.4\\.538 is used to compile the website.\n\n### python and Pipenv\n\nPython 3\\.11\\.7 is what we are currently using.\nThere are several IDEs that you can use. We've used VSCode. <!--and?-->\n\nI've set this up with Pipenv as an environment manager, but may switch.\n\nInstall pipenv if you don't already have it.\nFrom the project top-level folder, run from a command line `pipenv install`.\nThis may take some time, as it creates and populates an environment with all the required packages.\n\n### Building the site\n\nFrom your pipenv (e.g. by starting in the root folder and running `pipenv shell`), run `quarto render`.\nThis should run all the python snippets (using the pipenv python), caching some of the results,\nand render the output into `/docs` for you to preview.\n(For now, the github pages are also served directly from `/docs`,\nbut eventually we will probably set up github actions to generate the docs on PR merges,\nat which point the local copy will be added to `.gitignore` and just for your preview.)\n\n<!-- TODO: contributors list as in tidymodels version -->\n\n",
