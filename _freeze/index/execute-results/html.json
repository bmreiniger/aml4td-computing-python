The structure is similar to the website, but the content here shows how to use this software for each topic.\n\n<!-- We also want these materials to be reusable and open. The sources are in the source [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aml4td/computing-tidymodels) with a Creative Commons license attached (see below). -->\n\n<!-- To cite this work, we suggest:  -->\n\n## License {.unnumbered}\n\n <p xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" >This work is licensed under <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"license noopener noreferrer\" style=\"display:inline-block;\">CC BY-SA 4.0<img style=\"height:22px!important;margin-left:3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;\" src=\"https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/cc.svg?ref=chooser-v1\"><img style=\"height:22px!important;margin-left:3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;\" src=\"https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/by.svg?ref=chooser-v1\"><img style=\"height:22px!important;margin-left:3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;\" src=\"https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/sa.svg?ref=chooser-v1\"></a></p> \n\n## Intended Audience {.unnumbered}\n\nReaders should have used python before, but do not have to be experts. \nIf you are new to python, we suggest taking a look at the [_Python Data Science Handbook_](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/). \n\nYou do not have to be a modeling expert either. We hope that you have used a linear or logistic regression before and understand basic statistical concepts such as correlation, variability, probabilities, etc. \n\n## How can I ask questions? \n\nIf you have questions about the content, it is probably best to ask on a public forum, like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) for programmatic questions, or the [data science](https://datascience.stackexchange.com) or [statistics](https://stats.stackexchange.com/) Stack Exchange sites. You'll most likely get a faster answer there if you take the time to ask the questions in the best way possible.\n\nIf you want a direct answer from us, you should follow what Max calls [_Yihui's Rule_](https://yihui.org/en/2017/08/so-gh-email/): add an issue to GitHub (labeled as \"Discussion\") first. It may take some time for us to get back to you. \n\n<!-- If you think there is a bug, please [file an issue](https://github.com//aml4td/computing-tidymodels/issues).  -->\n\n## Can I contribute?  {.unnumbered}\n\nThere is a [contributing page](chapters/contributing.html) with details on how to get up and running to compile the materials and suggestions on how to help. \n\nIf you just want to fix a typo, you can make a pull request to alter the appropriate `.qmd` file. \n\nPlease feel free to improve the quality of this content by submitting **pull requests**. \n<!-- A merged PR will make you appear in the contributor list.  -->\n\n## Computing Notes {.unnumbered}\n\n[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) version 1\\.4\\.538 was used to compile and render the materials.  \n<!-- (View this page's source html, and you should find the version of Quarto used.) -->\n\nPython version 3\\.11\\.7 was used for computations. \nFor the list of python packages used and their versions, see the Pipfile in the source repository.\n\n",
